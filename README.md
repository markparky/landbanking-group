## 🚀 Breakdown

A mostly complete mini-project :)

Time developing: 3.5 hours (tests took longer than wanted/expected)
Planning: 1.5 hours
Studying: 5 hours <-- I havn't used react in 3 years so forgive me if my code is more academic than production-ready.

### 🤖 Tech used
- React
- Tailwind
- react-query
- jest
- local-storage

In tackling this assignment, I approached the open-ended scope with a focus on delivering key features within the 3-hour timeframe, balancing speed with functionality. While I adhered to the specified implementation time, I invested a considerable amount of effort in planning and preparation, allowing me to prioritize and maximize the impact of my contributions.

Given the time constraints, I focused on demonstrating essential skills. While I opted to use Tailwind CSS for styling, I found it to be a bit time-consuming, and in hindsight, a Sass-based approach might have streamlined the process by allowing me to leverage familiar properties. Tests were not prioritized in this round due to the limited timeframe and the showcase-oriented nature of the task. Although I attempted to implement some tests, I encountered issues running them. I’ve included a few __oldTests__ to illustrate my previous work with testing, though they're from a past project.

I decided to keep this all on one page to save time + debugging effort. Just happy it's not all in App.jsx.

Lastly, I ran out of time to implement the attributes, but the system's core functionality remains intact and coherent without them.

### Main Features
- searching for animals via API
- displaying animals
- deselecting/selecting favorites

### Nice to haves
- Rating (broken)

### 📝 ToDo
- Attributes
- Memoize
- Filter search results by already favorites
- Add enter on search
- Responsive
- move to separate pages

### 🐛 Known Bugs
- Rating fires twice (Look at render cycles in general)
- Text and rating overlap
- Rating not saved on browser storage

### 📈 Future 
- commit hooks etc
- Question whether to have the search results in context? <— maybe anti pattern

### Distant Future
- Images
- closest game park with selected animals
- Match with people same animals
- Insights on what attributes you're generally into
- Neo pet with all the attributes (kinda a joke)
